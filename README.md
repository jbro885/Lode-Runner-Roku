## About the Project

I developed this project during the nights and weekends of September/2016, after finishing the port of 
[Prince of Persia for Roku](https://github.com/lvcabral/Prince-of-Persia-Roku) as part of my studies about BrightScript 2D gamming API.

There are six selectable sprite modes from the classic computer ports: 
* Apple II (original version)
* Commodore 64, 
* IBM-DOS CGA, 
* Atari 8 bits
* Sinclair ZX Spectrum 
* NES

**Note:** The sound effects are from the Commodore 64 port.

The player can also select from five different versions of the game (level sets): 
* Classic (150 levels)
* Championship (50 levels)
* Professional (150 levels)
* Revenge (17 levels) 
* LR Fan Book (66 levels).
The level sets, guards AI and some assets were converted from the [Javascript Lode Runner](https://github.com/SimonHung/LodeRunner_TotalRecall) project by Simon Hung.

The also has a **Custom Level Editor** where you can create up to 15 personalized maps.

## How to Play

* You can play the game (on a Chrome based browser) with the **Roku emulator** I also developed, check it at: https://lvcabral.com/brs
* If you have a Roku or Roku TV you can install the game using this link: https://my.roku.com/add/LodeRunnerPreview
* You can also _side load_ the game on you Roku, downloading the [latest release zip](https://github.com/lvcabral/Lode-Runner-Roku/releases) using the developer mode ([click here to see how](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/getting-started/developer-setup.md)).
